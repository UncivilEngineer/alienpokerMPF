# alienpokerMPF
A P-roc project using Mission Pinball Framework with a P-roc and snux driver board.

This project uses the Mission Pinball Framework as the code basis for a re-write of the ruleset for the 1979 Williams
pinball game "Alien Poker".  The code is intended to run on real hardware with the addition of a LCD screen.
